Extends the WordPress REST API post, term, and user query results with an array of meta tags and Schema JSON-LD markup.

== Description ==

<!-- about -->

**Extends the WordPress REST API post, term, and user query results:**

* The `html` array includes HTML formatted meta tags and Schema JSON-LD (aka LD+JSON) scripts, as they appear in the webpage head section.
* The `json` array provides Schema JSON-LD (aka LD+JSON) scripts in their decoded format.
* The `parts` array offers meta tag attributes (aka "the parts") as arrays, making it easier to find and use specific meta tag values.

There is no add-on settings page for this plugin - simply install and activate the plugin.
